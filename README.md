# OpenDiabetes Atlas

**OpenDiabetes Atlas** is an open, public-interest project that combines verified diabetes data with clear explanations and family-centered context.

The goal is to make diabetes easier to understand for non-medical audiences while documenting how access, cost, and policy shape real lives.

This project prioritizes clarity, transparency, and ethical use of data.

## Why this project exists

A close family member of mine lives with diabetes.

Through them, I’ve seen that diabetes is often discussed in numbers and abstractions, while the daily effort, financial strain, and emotional labor remain invisible.

This project exists to bridge that gap — using open data responsibly and centering families without exploiting personal stories.

## What’s included

- Evidence-based explanations of diabetes and its types
- Comparative data on prevalence, cost, and acces
