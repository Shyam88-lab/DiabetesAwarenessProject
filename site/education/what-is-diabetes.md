# What Is Diabetes?

Diabetes is a chronic condition that affects how the body regulates blood glucose (blood sugar).

Glucose is a primary source of energy. Diabetes occurs when the body cannot properly produce or use insulin — a hormone essential for moving glucose from the bloodstream into cells.

## Why insulin matters

Insulin acts like a key. Without it:
- Glucose builds up in the blood
- Cells are deprived of energy
- Long-term damage can occur to organs and blood vessels

## Diabetes is not a single disease

“Diabetes” describes a group of conditions with different causes, risk factors, and management needs.

The most common forms are:
- Type 1 diabetes
- Type 2 diabetes
- Gestational diabetes

Each type requires different care approaches.

## A condition managed daily

Diabetes management often involves:
- Monitoring blood glucose
- Medication or insulin
- Food planning
- Physical activity
- Ongoing medical care

This daily workload is frequently underestimated, especially for families and caregivers.

---

## What diabetes is NOT

- It is not caused by laziness
- It is not always preventable
- It is not the same for every person

Misunderstanding diabetes contributes to stigma and inadequate support.

## Why understanding matters

Clear understanding:
- Reduces stigma
- Improves support for families
- Informs better policy decisions
- Encourages equitable access to care
