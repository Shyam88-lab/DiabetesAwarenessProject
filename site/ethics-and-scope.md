# Ethics, Scope, and Limitations

OpenDiabetes Atlas is an educational and advocacy-oriented project. It is not a clinical resource.

---

## What this project does

- Explains diabetes using verified public data
- Translates statistics into accessible language
- Highlights systemic and structural factors affecting care
- Acknowledges family and caregiver impact

---

## What this project does NOT do

- Provide medical advice
- Recommend treatments, medications, or dosages
- Replace guidance from healthcare professionals
- Collect user data or personal information

---

## Use of data

All data presented here:
- Comes from reputable public or academic sources
- Is cited with publication year
- Is contextualized with known limitations

Where estimates vary, ranges are shown instead of single values.

---

## Bias and underrepresentation

Diabetes data often underrepresents:
- Low-income populations
- Undocumented individuals
- Rural communities
- Countries with limited reporting infrastructure

Reported numbers should be understood as **minimum estimates**, not complete counts.

---

## Family and lived experience

Family and caregiver perspectives are included to provide context, not anecdotal proof.

No identifying details are shared.

---

## Accessibility commitments

- Plain-language summaries before technical sections
- Alt text for all visuals
- Colorblind-safe charts
- Readable contrast and font sizing

---

## Accountability

This project is open-source to allow:
- Public review
- Correction
- Improvement

Transparency is a feature, not a weakness.
